_Create different js files for each exercise. Import them into your HTML file to check them_

## Exercise 1: String Repeater

Useâ€‹ `â€‹window.prompt()â€‹â€‹` â€‹onceâ€‹ â€‹toâ€‹ â€‹queryâ€‹ â€‹theâ€‹ â€‹userâ€‹ â€‹forâ€‹ â€‹aâ€‹ â€‹string,â€‹ andâ€‹ â€‹againâ€‹ â€‹toâ€‹ â€‹queryâ€‹ â€‹theâ€‹ â€‹user forâ€‹ â€‹aâ€‹ â€‹number,â€‹ which we'll call x.â€‹ Useâ€‹ â€‹`â€‹window.alert()â€‹â€‹` â€‹toâ€‹ â€‹displayâ€‹ â€‹theâ€‹ â€‹sameâ€‹ â€‹string,â€‹ repeatedâ€‹ â€‹xâ€‹ â€‹times.â€‹ â€‹Youâ€‹ â€‹may assumeâ€‹ â€‹appropriateâ€‹ â€‹input.â€‹

## Exercise 2: Odd or Even

Useâ€‹ `â€‹window.prompt()â€‹â€‹` â€‹toâ€‹ â€‹queryâ€‹ â€‹the userâ€‹ â€‹forâ€‹ â€‹aâ€‹ number.â€‹ â€‹Useâ€‹ â€‹`â€‹window.alert()â€‹â€‹` â€‹toâ€‹ â€‹tellâ€‹ â€‹theâ€‹ userâ€‹ `"thatâ€‹ â€‹numberâ€‹ â€‹isâ€‹ â€‹odd"`,â€‹ `â€‹"thatâ€‹ â€‹numberâ€‹ â€‹is even"`,â€‹ â€‹orâ€‹ â€‹`"thatâ€‹ â€‹isâ€‹ â€‹notâ€‹ â€‹aâ€‹ â€‹number"`,â€‹ â€‹asâ€‹ â€‹isâ€‹ appropriate.

## Exercise 3: Text Adventure

Take the user on a short text adventure of your own composition. Use `window.alert()` to describe to them a situation, and `window.prompt()` to collect input from them to see what they will do. For example:

- Window: `What direction do you travel in? (N, S, E, W)`
- User: `N`
- Window: `You see a babbling brook.`

## Final Exercise: Major Keys

It's time to make our own pseudo-form. Inspired by major Snapchat influences, we've decided to write an app that allows our user to prioritize the things/concepts that they hold dear - in other words, their Major Keys.

In the HTML file in this folder, you have a few empty HTML elements. You have an `h1` tag, an ordered list, and five `li`s inside. Except for the ordered list, each element has a unique `id` property.

Your task is to create a window dialogue that asks the following questions:

- What is your name?
- What is your first key?
- What is your second key?
- What is your third key?
- What is your fourth key?
- What is your fifth key?

Take each user response. Change the `h1` tag to read "<name>'s Major Keys", where <name> is the user's answer to the first question. Each `li` element should contain the answer to each of their subsequent questions.

### Bonus

Allow the user to **highlight each key**, in the color of your choice, by CAPITALIZING the word in their input. Highlight the word and convert it to lowercase.
